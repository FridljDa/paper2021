Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when they include a subset of ages 85-100+ because populations are not"
"available for those ages. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#Ages 85-100."

"3. Circumstances in Georgia for the years 2008 and 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of"

"4. Circumstances in New Jersey for the year 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code"
"R99, ""Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality"" and therefore unusually low death counts in other ICD-10 codes,"
"most notably R95, ""Sudden Infant Death Syndrome"" and X40-X49, ""Unintentional poisoning."" Caution should be used in"

"8. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
